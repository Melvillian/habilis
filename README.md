## Orbit Fork Notice

Early on in the lifecycle of this project we chose to fork the majority of the
Apache-licensed code from
[Andy Matuschak's Orbit repo](https://github.com/andymatuschak/orbit). Andy has
a solid well-written codebase perfect for many different flavors of SRS
software, and since his code is permissively licensed we decided to fork it
rather than try to re-invent the wheel.

Our codebase differs from Andy's in that Orbit's `app/` and `backend/` packages
have been re-written from scratch to better match the needs of our project.
Instead, we have the `web-frontend/` and `server/` packages which are the
primary focus of our work.

## Packages

This is Habilis' mono-repo, comprising many modular packages. You'll want to run
`bun install` in the root to install dependencies before doing anything else.
(We use [Bun](https://bun.sh) as our package manager and script runner.) From
there, `bun run build` will build all the packages, and `bun test` will run all
the tests.

See the table below for an overview of this monorepo's packages, and see Readme
files in individual package folders for details on each package.

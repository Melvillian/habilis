# Meeting Notes

## April 18, 2024

Will and Alex talk, they decide

- probably gonna use Svelte and Typescript because that's what we already know
  and they have sufficient features for what we wanna do.
- unknown whether we plan to do a rewrite or not, but all things being equal
  it'd be nice
- next step is architecture doc with user flows
- talked about having a daily standup

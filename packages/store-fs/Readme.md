# `@withorbit/store-fs`

`OrbitStoreFS` implements an on-disk `OrbitStore` in a standard format: a folder containing a SQLite database (for all events and entities) and a folder of attachments. This folder can be backed up and manipulated locally.

This library is compatible with Node.js and React Native environments.

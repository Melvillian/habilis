# `@withorbit/store-shared`

`OrbitStore` implements a standard interface for interacting with a database of Orbit user data and an associated blob store for attachments. This package contains types shared by the two main implementations, `@withorbit/store-fs` (for Node.JS and React Native) and `@withorbit/store-web` (for web browsers).

This library is compatible with Node.js, React Native, and web browser contexts.

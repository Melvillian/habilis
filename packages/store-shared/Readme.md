# `@habilis/store-shared`

`OrbitStore` implements a standard interface for interacting with a database of
Orbit user data and an associated blob store for attachments. This package
contains types shared by the two main implementations, `@habilis/store-fs` (for
Node.JS and React Native) and `@habilis/store-web` (for web browsers).

This library is compatible with Node.js, React Native, and web browser contexts.

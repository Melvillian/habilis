# @withorbit/anki-import

This module implements a non-production-ready import process for Anki `.apkg` files into Orbit. It's implemented as a library; see `cli/importAnkiCollection.ts` for an example usage. A production client of this library should inform the user of potential lossiness during the transformation (and should probably be integrated into `app`).

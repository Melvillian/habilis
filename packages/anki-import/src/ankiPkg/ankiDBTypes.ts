/* Array of arrays describing, for each template T, which fields are required to generate T.
The array is of the form [T,string,list], where:
-  T is the ordinal of the template.
- The string is 'none', 'all' or 'any'.
- The list contains ordinal of fields, in increasing order.
  The meaning is as follows:
- if the string is 'none', then no cards are generated for this template. The list should be empty.
- if the string is 'all' then the card is generated only if each field of the list are filled
- if the string is 'any', then the card is generated if any of the field of the list is filled.

  The algorithm to decide how to compute req from the template is explained on:
